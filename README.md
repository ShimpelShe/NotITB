# NotITB
Uh, blockly thingy i dunno

## What is NotITB?

It's a sorta blockly project to make uh NotITG Modfiles and stuff, not to make complete complex modcharts or anything but something just.. functional

## Why is NotITB?

I'm too lazy to write modcharts and besides there are others who don't know what's a default.xml file and why do they need it in a "Lua" folder, nor why Lua is stored in an XML file.  
  
Or perhaps there are other lazy people which don't wanna go through the hassle of writing a modfile. Which is.. i don't know?

## How to NotITB?
Just download source, extract it into any folder, enter it such that you're above `/src`, and then open terminal, and start it by typing in `npm start`.  
  
If there's anything like an uninstalled dependency, just search it online dude.
