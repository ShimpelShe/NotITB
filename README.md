# NotITB
Uh, blockly thingy i dunno

## What is NotITB?
It's a sorta blockly project to make uh NotITG Modfiles and stuff, not to make complete complex modcharts or anything but something just.. functional

## Why is NotITB?
I'm too lazy to write modcharts and besides there are others who don't know what's a default.xml file and why do they need it in a "Lua" folder, nor why Lua is stored in an XML file.  
  
Or perhaps there are other lazy people which don't wanna go through the hassle of writing a modfile. Which is.. to be expected
